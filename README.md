# TrainAI Data Annotation Portfolio

## Overview

The TrainAI Data Annotation Portfolio is a comprehensive collection of resources designed to facilitate the annotation of text data, evaluate AI-generated outputs, and moderate content effectively. This portfolio aims to provide clear guidelines, sample datasets, and evaluation metrics to ensure high-quality data annotation and content moderation practices.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **text-annotation/**: Contains resources for annotating text data.
   - **dataset_sample.csv**: A sample dataset for text annotation, including columns for text data, labels, and relevant metadata.
   - **annotation_guidelines.pdf**: Guidelines for annotating text data, including instructions, examples, and best practices.
   - **labeled_examples.csv**: Examples of text data that have been annotated, showcasing the annotation process.

2. **ai-output-evaluation/**: Provides resources for evaluating AI-generated outputs.
   - **evaluation_rubric.md**: Outlines the criteria and metrics for evaluating AI outputs, focusing on accuracy, relevance, and coherence.
   - **sample_evaluations.csv**: Contains sample evaluations of AI-generated outputs, serving as a reference for applying the evaluation rubric.

3. **content-moderation/**: Offers guidelines for moderating content.
   - **moderation_guidelines.md**: Details the criteria for acceptable and unacceptable content, with examples and definitions.
   - **classified_samples.csv**: Samples of content classified according to moderation guidelines, including original content and classification labels.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this portfolio is to enhance the quality and consistency of data annotation, AI output evaluation, and content moderation. By providing structured resources and clear guidelines, users can effectively navigate the complexities of these processes and contribute to the development of reliable AI systems.

## Usage Instructions

- Navigate to the relevant directory based on your needs (text annotation, AI output evaluation, or content moderation).
- Refer to the provided guidelines and sample files to understand the processes and standards expected.
- Utilize the sample datasets and evaluations as references to ensure consistency and quality in your work.

For any questions or further information, please refer to the specific guidelines in each directory or contact the project maintainers.
